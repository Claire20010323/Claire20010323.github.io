The Association licensed its first cat shows in 1906; one show was held in Buffalo, New York and another show was held in Detroit, Michigan. CFA’s first Annual Business Meeting was held in 1907 at Madison Square Garden. In 1906, CFA published the first Stud Book and Register in the Cat Journal. In 1909, Volume I of the Stud Book was published in book form. The Stud Book and Register served as CFA’s first published records of cat breeding and lineage as it began a tradition of providing a much-needed service to the cat fancy. On September 18, 1919, Articles of Incorporation were filed in New York State. By 1920, CFA was on its way to becoming the largest registry of pedigreed cats that it is today. </span></h1></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 20px;font-size: 25px">  CFA has grown steadily over the years from its humble beginnings, licensing two shows to licensing approximately 400 shows each season, worldwide. Membership in CFA is granted to clubs who have gone through an application and election process. Currently, CFA has over 600 member clubs. CFA shows are judged by individuals who have met high qualification criteria and have completed a rigorous training program which qualifies the judges to evaluate the show cats using a CFA Breed Standard for each one of its recognized breeds. To date, CFA has registered over 2 million pedigreed cats. </p>
